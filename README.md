## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository contains:

- **Data files** from the SPARC database and derived datasets used in the BTFR analysis.
- **Python plotting scripts** to reproduce each figure from the paper.
- Example outputs of each figure in `figs/`.

The goal is to provide a transparent, fully reproducible pipeline from raw galaxy kinematics to the final plots shown in the publication.
